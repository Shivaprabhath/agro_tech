# 🌾 AgroTech - Empowering Small Farmers Through Technology

AgroTech is a community-based platform designed to support small and rural farmers by addressing critical challenges related to surplus crop distribution, resource sharing, and sustainable farming. Our goal is to reduce waste, lower costs, increase profits, and encourage collaboration within the farming community.

## 🚜 Problem Statement

Small farmers in rural areas often struggle to:

- Efficiently distribute surplus crops.
- Share resources like irrigation equipment or machinery.
- Reduce costs and financial strain due to lack of structured trade and collaboration mechanisms.

Without a platform for exchanging goods and services, farmers waste valuable resources and miss out on opportunities to collaborate and grow.

### 3. Bartering System

A unique trade mechanism where farmers can exchange resources or crops without monetary transactions.  
Example: One farmer trades irrigation equipment for another farmer’s surplus rice.  
This promotes cost-saving and enhances community collaboration.
